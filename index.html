                I am a senior in software engineering at Auburn University with a minor in mathematics. I have worked as a web developer in professional environments through both internship and co-op. I like to be involved on campus, having previously been a member of the Auburn University Marching Band, TigerDev Video Game Development Club, and Wesley Foundation. Today, I am an officer in my fraternity, Beta Upsilon Chi, a part of a college ministry, and lead my own Bible Study. Check out some of my previous work around my website, and if you would like to reach out to me, head to the contact tab. If you want to get an idea of what I do for fun, be sure to check out the personal tab, too!
